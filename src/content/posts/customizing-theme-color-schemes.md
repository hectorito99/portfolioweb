Red Hat OpenShift Administration I: Managing Containers and Kubernetes (DO180) prepares OpenShift cluster administrators to manage Kubernetes workloads and to collaborate with developers, DevOps engineers, system administrators, and SREs to ensure the availability of application workloads. This course focuses on managing typical end-user applications that are often accessible from a web or mobile UI and that represent most cloud-native and containerized workloads. Managing applications also includes deploying and updating their dependencies, such as databases, messaging, and authentication systems.

> **Note:** This course is based on Red Hat OpenShift 4.12.
